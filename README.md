# Advanced Process Manager with Process Synchronization

## Implemented Functionalities
1. **Process and Thread Management:** This program allows you to create and manage processes and threads. You can create new threads with custom names and terminate them when needed.

2. **Process Listing:** The tool provides the capability to list running processes and displays details about each process, such as the process ID, parent process ID, and its current state.

3. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** It enables communication between processes through IPC. You can send and receive messages between processes using pipes.

4. **Process Synchronization:** The tool demonstrates process synchronization using a mutex. It showcases how to use a mutex to synchronize access to shared resources and ensure that multiple processes or threads can safely access critical sections of code.

5. **Producer-Consumer Problem:** The program addresses the classic producer-consumer problem using semaphores. It creates a shared buffer, and multiple producer and consumer threads interact with the buffer, ensuring that producers don't produce when the buffer is full and consumers don't consume when it's empty.

6. **Reader-Writer Problem:** The tool also demonstrates the reader-writer problem using semaphores. It illustrates how multiple readers and writers access a shared resource, with readers allowed simultaneous access while writers require exclusive access.

## Installation
- To use this advanced process manager, simply import the necessary libraries and run the `main.py` file.
- The tool generates a process manager log file that contains comprehensive logs of the program's activities, helping you monitor the execution and diagnose issues effectively.

## Results & Explanation
This advanced process manager, along with synchronization mechanisms, provides an efficient way to manage and monitor processes and threads. It ensures proper synchronization to prevent data corruption and resource conflicts. It's a valuable tool for understanding and implementing synchronization mechanisms for common problems like producer-consumer and reader-writer scenarios.

## Discussion
The program showcases how synchronization mechanisms like semaphores and mutexes can be applied to solve common synchronization problems encountered in multi-process and multi-threaded applications. It offers a practical understanding of how to protect shared resources and coordinate the execution of multiple processes and threads.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this advanced process manager with process synchronization is a valuable tool for both learning and practical implementation. It equips users with the knowledge and tools needed to manage processes and threads effectively, ensuring secure data access and minimizing conflicts. It's a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit when working with concurrent and parallel processing.
